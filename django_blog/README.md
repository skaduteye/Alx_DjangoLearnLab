   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd django_blog
   ```

3. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations blog
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Create a superuser** (for admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   - Main site: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Admin panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   - Login: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
   - Register: http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/
   - Profile: http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/ (requires login)

## Quick Start Guide

2. Fill in username, email, and password

## Configuration

### Database
The project uses SQLite by default, configured in `django_blog/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        'USER': '',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '',
    }
}
```

To use PostgreSQL or another database, modify the `DATABASES` setting accordingly.

### Static Files
Static files are configured in `settings.py`:

```python
STATIC_URL = 'static/'
```

Static files are organized under `blog/static/blog/` directory.

### Templates
Templates are stored in `blog/templates/blog/` directory. Django automatically discovers these templates because `APP_DIRS` is set to `True` in the `TEMPLATES` setting.
